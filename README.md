# Connect 4 Game - AP Computer Science A Final Project

## Overview
This project implements a classic Connect 4 game with a modern web interface and AI opponent. The game is built using a Java backend for game logic and a React frontend for the user interface. The project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles, data structures, algorithms, and web development concepts learned in AP Computer Science A.

### Problem Statement
Traditional board games often lack engaging digital interfaces and intelligent opponents. This project aims to create an interactive Connect 4 game that combines classic gameplay with modern technology, providing an engaging user experience while demonstrating technical proficiency in software development.

### Proposed Solution
A web-based Connect 4 game featuring:
- Clean, responsive user interface
- Real-time game state management
- AI opponent with random move generation
- Win detection and automatic game reset
- Smooth animations and visual feedback

## Objectives
1. Implement a fully functional Connect 4 game with proper win detection
2. Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface
3. Develop a reliable client-server architecture
4. Implement basic AI opponent functionality
5. Ensure smooth gameplay with proper error handling
6. Demonstrate understanding of key AP CS A concepts

### Key Success Metrics
